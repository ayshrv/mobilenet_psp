- [x] Regularisation loss
- [ ] Dropout
- [ ] Data Augmentation


- [ ] initializers for all layers beta gamma. is_training???
- [ ] 90x90 for loss and 713x713 for accuracies. Process labels accordingly.
- [x] See others code for simplying things like label processing and loss calculation
- [x] Configure learning rate 20 times for PSP Module
- [x] Remove Segmentation Faults
- [ ] Configure Training Parameters

- [ ] Stop training beta functionality


NOTHING IS WORKING LIST:
- [x] Check whether image and label are loaded correctly.
    - [ ] Do not know about image scaling
- [x] Check whether pre trained weight loading is correct.
- [x] Check whether weight initialization is correct.
- [ ] check whether whether labels are calculated correctly and the loss also.
- [ ] Check learning rate
- [ ] Check training is correct or NOTHING
