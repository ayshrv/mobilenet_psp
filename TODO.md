- [x] initializers for all layers beta gamma. is_training???
- [ ] 90x90 for loss and 713x713 for accuracies. Process labels accordingly.

NOTHING IS WORKING LIST:
- [x] Check whether image and label are loaded correctly.
    - [ ] Do not know about image scaling
- [x] Check whether pre trained weight loading is correct.
- [x] Check whether weight initialization is correct.
- [x] check whether whether labels are calculated correctly and the loss also.
- [x] Check learning rate
- [x] Check training is correct or NOTHING
