- [x] Regularisation loss
- [ ] Dropout
- [ ] Data Augmentation
- [ ] Weight init from between


- [ ] initializers for all layers beta gamma. is_training???
- [ ] 90x90 for loss and 713x713 for accuracies. Process labels accordingly.
- [ ] See others code for simplying things like label processing and loss calculation
- [ ] Configure learning rate 20 times for PSP Module

NOTHING IS WORKING LIST:
- [x] Check whether image and label are loaded correctly.
    - [ ] Do not know about image scaling
